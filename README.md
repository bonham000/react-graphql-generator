# react-graphql-generator

This is a starter library used to bootstrap TypeScript types and React components from a GraphQL schema file. It relies on the excellent libraries [`gql-generator`](https://github.com/timqian/gql-generator) and [`@graphql-codegen/cli`](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator).
